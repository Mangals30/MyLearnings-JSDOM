My progress in udemy course learnings illustrated in DOM

The backgound color of the date and the color of the year changes dynamically.
The background color of the courses also change dynamically depending upon the status of the learnings.
If the learning is completed the background color changes to green, if the status is learnign the background color is yellow and if the status is yet to learn the background color is red.
The page is responsive.
